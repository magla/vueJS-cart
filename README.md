# VueJS example of an order cart application  
  
The cart application takes you through several categories of products and shows you the order summary at the end.   
It also takes in any previous order that has been saved on the server but not yet sent, and combines them with the available products.  
In case that the previous order had an item that has been removed in the meantime, the order list marks it.
After the order the customer can make another order.
